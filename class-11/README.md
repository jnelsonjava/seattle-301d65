# Server-side templating with EJS

## Feedback From Week 2

- I don't go back to my notes much
- Felt underwater but capable of swimming
- Arrays are feeling easier
- reduce / map / filter are still tough
- Spend 45 minutes to an hour on the reading notes
- Code Warmups rock
- Noticed many people in the class are struggling with accessing values
- People that want to solo the code challenges.

- Shoutout to Vij


## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Full-stack application skeleton scaffolding
- HTML5 Forms
- Server-side templating
- Google Books API
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:
- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application 
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library
